# The confidence gate

**Writing code is a claim of confidence.** Before emitting any, you must be able to answer one
question honestly: *am I sure this syntax is correct, for this version, in this application?*

That surety decomposes into a chain. **You may not advance past a link you cannot establish.**

```
intent  →  packages  →  version  →  syntax  →  fit
```

- **Intent** — what change is actually wanted, and what "done" means. Not the literal words of the
  request; the behaviour being asked for.
- **Packages** — which packages this app actually has, and which of them the change touches.
- **Version** — which major of each. Syntax is a property of the version, not of the library.
- **Syntax** — the exact form for that version: prefix, namespace, registration, signature.
- **Fit** — does it belong here: this app's naming, schema, existing abstractions, layer.

Break the chain anywhere and the code you write is a guess wearing a confident face. Guesses here do
not fail loudly — they fail at runtime, in review, or in production, and cost an iteration each time.

## The distinction that makes this work

Taken from the `grill-me` pattern, and it is the whole discipline:

> **Facts about the codebase are your job. Decisions are the user's.**

- A **fact** is discoverable: what columns `invoices` has, which route is named `invoices.view`,
  whether `ChargeInvoice` already exists, what `pest` resolves to. **Look it up. Never ask.** Asking
  the user for something already in the repository is the failure this skill exists to prevent
  (`laravel-recon` is the mechanism).
- A **decision** is not discoverable: whether refunds should be partial, whether to add a second
  gateway now, whether breaking the API contract is acceptable. **Ask. Never decide silently.**

Most bad agent output comes from getting this backwards: deciding silently and asking about facts.

## When to run this — and when not to

Run it when the change has **decisions that are expensive to reverse**: data shape, auth model,
public API contract, a new class family, a package choice, a migration.

**Do not run it** for:

| Skip when | Why |
| --- | --- |
| The change is fully constrained — one obvious local fix | There is nothing to resolve |
| Iteration is fast and reversible — a style tweak, a view detail | You will see the result immediately |
| Prose, formatting, comments, a rename | No syntax risk |
| You already have the answer from `laravel-recon` | The chain is already established |

**Grilling is a cost, and it backfires as a tax on trivial work.** A skill that fires on every change
gets ignored on the changes that matter. Route it by the *reversibility* of the decision, not by the
size of the diff.

## The gate

Classify every link in the chain, honestly:

| State | Meaning | May you write code? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Established** | Verified — you read it, ran it, or fetched the version's page | Yes |
| **Assumed** | A named default, with the reason, and you disclosed it | Only if reversing it is cheap |
| **Unknown** | You do not actually know | **No.** Resolve it or stop |

Rules for the gate:

- **An unlabelled assumption is a violation.** "Assumed" with a stated reason is fine; silent
  plausibility is not.
- **Unknown + expensive to reverse → stop and ask.** Do not pick the most likely option and move on.
- **Unknown + cheap to reverse → proceed, but say so.** Name it as an assumption in the output.
- **Never write syntax you cannot cite.** If you cannot point to the version's documentation, this
  plugin's table, or the app itself, you do not know it.

## Asking well

When a link needs the user, use the `ask` tool:

- **One question at a time when the answers are dependent.** Batching dependent questions destroys
  the order that makes the interview converge — a later question's options depend on the earlier
  answer. Batch only genuinely independent questions (the host allows up to three).
- **Every question carries a recommended answer and the reason.** The user should be able to say
  "yes to your suggestion". An open question with no proposal transfers your work back to them.
- **Frame the consequence.** "If we make it `hasMany`, the migration needs a foreign key on the child
  and the eager-load changes. Recommend `hasMany`." Not "one-to-many or many-to-many?".
- **Stop asking when the frontier is empty.** Not when you are bored, and not after a fixed count.

`laravel-stack-interview` is the same discipline applied to the stack itself. Use that one for "which
stack is this"; use this one for "what are we building, and am I sure how".

## Where "I don't know" goes

Saying it is expected, not a failure. The plugin has somewhere to put it:

| Unknown | Resolve by |
| --- | --- |
| Which column / route / config key | `laravel-recon` — read it |
| Whether the syntax exists on this version | `laravel-versions/references/syntax-by-version.md` |
| The exact API for the installed major | Fetch the version-scoped page (`whats-new.md` lists the URLs) |
| A package's prefix or registration | `laravel-stack/references/package-syntax-map.md`; confirm registration-dependent prefixes in the app |
| Intent, scope, or an expensive design choice | Ask the user, with a recommendation |

If none of those settle it, **say so plainly and stop** rather than writing something plausible. A
stated gap costs one question. A confident guess costs an iteration and your credibility.

## Leave an artifact

The known weakness of the `grill-me` pattern is that the findings evaporate — the agent forgets them
next session. This plugin has durable surfaces, so **a grill session must leave something behind**:

- Resolved **facts** → `.reasonix/laravel-stack.md` (and `laravel-recon`'s ground-truth block)
- Recurring **decisions** → a project rule via `laravel-project-rules`, so it is not re-asked
- Structural **choices** → the five-line decision record from `laravel-design-decision`

Grilling without recording is paying the cost and discarding the benefit.

## Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why it is wrong |
| --- | --- |
| Asking the user for a fact that is in the repo | Wastes their attention on your lookup |
| Deciding silently and asking about facts | Exactly backwards — the root cause of misalignment |
| Five dependent questions in one batch | Destroys the dependency order; answers arrive unusable |
| Questions with no recommended answer | Transfers the thinking back to the user |
| Grilling a one-line fix | Kills the skill's credibility for the changes that matter |
| Writing the code, then asking "is this right?" | The gate is *before* the code, or it is not a gate |
| Treating "assumed" as "established" | The most dangerous state, because it feels like knowledge |

## Checklist

- [ ] Intent stated, not just the literal request
- [ ] Packages identified — facts looked up, not asked
- [ ] Version resolved for every package the change touches
- [ ] Syntax citable from the version's docs, this plugin's tables, or the app
- [ ] Fit checked against existing abstractions (`laravel-recon`, search before create)
- [ ] Every link classified: established / assumed / unknown
- [ ] No unknown link with an expensive-to-reverse decision left open
- [ ] Each question carried a recommendation and its reason
- [ ] Assumptions disclosed in the output, not buried
- [ ] Outcome recorded — profile, project rule, or decision record
